.. rubric:: Preparation

Preheat oven to 210ºC and grease a baking tray. To make the choux pastry, pour 
250 mL cold water to a pan and add the sugar, salt and butter chopped up. 
Bring to the boil and remove from the heat. Add the flour and mix well with a 
wooden spoon. Put back on a low heat for a few seconds so that the dough 
becomes dry and elastic. Remove from the heat and add the eggs, one at the 
time, while mixing energetically until the dough is homogenous. Form little 
balls of dough and spread on the baking tray, leaving space for them to 
expand. Bake for 15 minutes. Leave the oven ajar and bake for a further 5 
minutes. Let the choux to cool.

To prepare the sauce, melt the chocolate in a pan with the butter and milk on 
low heat and set aside. Split the choux in half and fill them with ice cream. 
Then pour the chocolate sauce over them and serve immediately.
