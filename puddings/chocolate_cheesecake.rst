.. rubric:: Preparation

Brush a round springform tin with melted butter and line the base and side 
with baking paper. Mix together the biscuit crumbs and butter, press firmly 
into the base of the tin and refrigerate for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 
moderate 180ÂºC. 

Beat the cream cheese and sugar with electric beater until smooth and creamy. 
Add the eggs, one at the time, beating well between each addition. Beat in the 
cocoa and sour cream until smooth. Beat in the cooled dark chocolate. Beat in 
the liqueur and pour over the base. Smooth the surface and bake for 45 
minutes. The cheesecake may not be fully set, but will firm up. Refrigerate 
overnight if possible.

Remove the cheesecake from the tin and put it on a board. Measure the height 
and add 5 mm. Cut a strip of baking paper this wide and 75 cm long. Pipe or 
drizzle the melted white chocolate in patterns of your choice. When just set, 
spread the dark chocolate over the entire baking paper. Allow the chocolate to 
settle a little, but you need to be able to bend the paper without it 
cracking.

Wrap the paper around the cheesecake with the chocolate inside. Seal the ends 
and hold the paper in place until the chocolate is completely set. Peel away 
the paper. Dust with cocoa powder and icing sugar.
