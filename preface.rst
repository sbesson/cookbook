Preface to this edition
=======================

The pursuit of academic gastronomy continues in America as I moved there  as  
a postdoctoral scientist. I spent just over a year in the East Bay before 
relocating to Boston where this second edition was compiled. In this edition,  
**Ox Posh Nosh** meets *the Best of Berkeley and Boston*.

The quality of the californian fresh product is fabulous and the new dishes 
listed here celebrate by their simplicity and freshness the high quality of 
the local fruit and vegetable. I have been accustomed during my stay to visit 
and shop at the wonderful Berkeley Bowl, the Farmer's market on week-ends and 
the Cheeseboard, which is the best cheese shop I ever encountered. Fruit 
picking on the East Coast fresh off the trees is also a lot of fun. There is a 
great advantage in buying the seasonal local produces as they are fresher and 
better quality. Moving to Boston has enabled me to revisit and expand the 
dessert and comfort food recipe, thanks to the cold weather. 

The added recipes are more favourites. Some are also delicious one-dish 
recipes that can be cooked on a camp fire on a dark night- put to test on 
trips in Yosemite. I would also like to thank my mother for the beautiful 
front cover drawing.

For the Americans who use the recipes and get confused with the vocab (and 
laugh at me about auberrrgines): courgettes are zucchini,  aubergines are 
eggplants, rocket is arugula and coriander is cilantro. 
When a recipe calls for dark and milk chocolate, it calls for bittersweet and 
semi-sweet chocolate respectively. Double cream and single cream in the UK are 
in fact heavy cream and light cream in the US while crème fraiche, can 
be substituted for sour cream.
