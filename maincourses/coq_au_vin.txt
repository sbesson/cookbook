.. rubric:: Preparation

A day ahead or in the morning, marinate the chicken alongside the sliced 
carrots and onions in the red wine. Add the thyme, bay leaves and 10 grains of 
pepper.

Next day, pat chicken dry with paper towels. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large 
pan or dish over medium-high heat. Add chicken and sauté until skin is 
brown, turning once, about 10 minutes. Then put chicken aside and remove the 
vegetable from the marinade and cook in the pan for 3-4 minutes. Add the flour 
to them and mix (it helps make the sauté thicken). Add the chicken back in. 
Now is time to add the cognac and flame the chicken if you are using cognac.

Then add the marinade and the chicken stock. Season with salt and pepper, 
bring to the boil and cover for 2-3 hours on low heat.

Just before serving,  pan-fry the sliced mushrooms and bacon and add to the 
chicken.  Simmer until heated through and flavours blend, stirring 
occasionally, about 10 minutes.
