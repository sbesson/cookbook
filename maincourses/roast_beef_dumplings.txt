Svíčková na smetaně s knedliky or Roast beef in a creamy vegetable sauce with dumplings 
=======================================================================================
*Serves 4-5 with plenty of leftovers*

This is a great recipe of Martin's family to add to the cultural diversity of 
this volume of recipes. It is a traditional Czech recipe, perfect for cold 
winter days, the sauce is in particular wonderful and enhances the roast 
flavours of the meat and dumplings. And if you can get someone to cook it for 
you while you read by the fire, that's even better.

.. rubric:: Ingredients

- 1 kg beef for roasting (tenderloin is the best, otherwise top sirloin),
- smoked pork belly fat (or very streaky bacon). 

- 3-4 medium :index:`carrots` (the more carrots, the sweeter the sauce),
- 3 small parsley roots,
- ½ large celery (the more celery, the crisper the sauce),
- 1 small onion.

- 80 g butter,
- olive oil,
- salt,
- ground black pepper,
- allspice (4-5 whole fruits),
- 5 bay leaves,
- black pepper (10 whole peppercorns),
- sour cream (100 mL),
- ½ teaspoon ground :index:`lemon` rind.

.. rubric::  Meat preparation (day 1)

Clean the meat by removing all fat and membranes. To add moisture during 
roasting, larder the beef by threading strips of pork fat through small 
incisions in the meat (the trick here is to cut the fat/bacon into strips 
approx. 3-4 mm thick and then put them into the freezer for a couple of hours 
for them to harden). Sprinkle the meat with salt and pepper and smear with 
olive oil. Leave in the fridge overnight.

.. rubric:: Roasting (day 2)

Heat a little olive oil in a pot (this is going to be a pot roast, so a large 
oven-friendly pot is needed, alternatively use a glass roasting dish with a 
lid), then sear the meat until brown. Set the meat aside together with all the 
fat. In the same pot, melt the butter, add diced carrots, parsley root and 
celery, and sauté for approx. 10 minutes. Add allspice, whole pepper and bay 
leaves. Towards the end, add chopped onion and sauté for another 1-2 minutes. 

In the meantime, boil 1 litre water in a kettle. Put meat (and the juices) 
back to the pot. Add water so that the meat is half-immersed. Roast in the 
oven for approx. 2 hrs 200°C until tender. The meat needs to be checked 
regularly - turn at least once during the roasting and pour the juice over the 
meat every 20 minutes. Remove the meat from the pot and set aside.  Cut into thin slices with a carving knife.

To make the sauce, remove all the bay leaves from the sauce base - IMPORTANT. 
While still warm, blend the vegetables using a hand-held blender to create a 
smooth, thick sauce. Heat on medium heat. Add sour cream (start with 2-3 
tablespoons and then add more to taste). If the sauce is too thick, dilute 
with a little bit of milk. Simmer for approx. 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and 
add lemon rind. The sauce in now ready to be served, although it somehow 
always tastes a bit better if served re-heated the day after.

Serve the beef  with Bohemian dumplings, generously overlaid with the hot 
creamy sauce. Garnish with a spoonful of cranberry sauce and a slice of 
lemon.

Bohemian dumplings
------------------

- 3-4 medium soft white bread rolls,
- 750 g plain wheat flour (the coarser, the better),
- 1 egg,
- 1 cup milk,
- 1 tbsp baking powder,
- pinch of salt.

Dice the bread rolls. Add flour, egg, baking powder, salt and milk. Work 
manually into thick dough. Divide into two ellipsoidal loaves and let rise for 
30 minutes. Boil 3L of water, add 1 tsp salt. Put the loaves into the boiling 
water. They will stick to the bottom first but will eventually float. Boil for 
15 minutes, then turn the loaves upside down and boil for another 15 minutes. 
Remove loaves from the water and put on a flat surface. Cut into thin (1cm 
slices) with a piece of sewing thread (don't try to cut with a knife, it 
doesn't work with warm dumplings).

Note: Dumplings may be frozen. To reheat, place frozen dumpling slices into a 
steamer and set over boiling water. Cover and steam until warm.
