.. rubric:: Preparation

If using shrimps, put them in a bowl. 

For fish, bring a half-pint water to the boil, add salt and poach the fish in 
it.  Let the water return to the boil and simmer 3-4 minutes. Remove the pan 
from the heat and let the fish cool down. Chop up when cold into a bowl.

Add the lime juice, onion, radishes, tomatoes and cilantro to the bowl with 
the shrimp or fish. Stir, taste and season with salt (1 teaspoon should be 
about right). 

Serve with the warm tortillas, and with guacamole and sour cream.
