Combine the pesto sauce, oil, lemon juice and black pepper in a shallow

marinate for at least 2 hours in a refrigerator.

To cook the vegetable, place the peppers, onion, garlic and courgettes into a 
roasting tin. Mix well to ensure that they are coated in oil. Place in a 
preheated oven to 220°C for 20 minutes turning occasionally. Reduce the 
temperature to 200°C. Place the salmon in the oven and bake uncovered for a 
further 20 minutes, or until the flesh flakes easily. Place each steak on a 
bed of roasted vegetables and pour any remaining juices on the top. Serve with 
couscous and fresh basil.
