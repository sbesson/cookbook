.. rubric:: Preparation

In a bowl, combine the ingredients for the crumble. Set the bowl aside.

Preheat the oven to 375°. Butter and flour a 9-by-13 inch pan.
In a small saucepan, bring the orange juice to a simmer. Stir in the
cranberries and cover the pan. Let the cranberries simmer for about 3 minutes, 
then remove the pan from the heat, and let the mixture cool.

In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt 
for the cake.

In a large bowl or in an electric mixer, blend the sugar with the butter until 
the mixture is light and fluffy . Beat in the eggs, one by one, and the 
vanilla, lemon rind, and ginger. Blend in the buttermilk or yogurt , then fold 
in half the flour mixture. Stir in the sour cream. Stain the cranberries, and 
add them to the batter, Then fold in the remaining flour mixture, being 
careful not to overmix.

Spoon the batter into the casserole pan. Sprinkle the crumble evenly over the 
batter. Bake the cake for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a knife inserted the 
centre comes out clean.

Let the cake cool for 10 minutes before cutting it. This coffeecake keeps 
well, wrapped and refrigerated, for up to 4 days. Well wrapped, it freezes 
well, too.
