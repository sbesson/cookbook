Preheat oven to 220ºC and grease a baking tray. Sieve the flour, salt, mustard 
powder and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Reserve 2 tbsp of the grated cheese 
and stir the rest into the bowl with the cooked and mashed potatoes.

Pour in the water and the oil, and stir all the ingredients together. Mix them 
all to make a soft dough. Turn out the dough to a floured surface and shape it 
into a 20 cm disk. Place it on the baking tray and mark it into 4 portions 
with a knife, without cutting through. Sprinkle with the reserved cheese. Bake 
in the oven for about 25-30 minutes.
