Preheat oven to 180ÂºC and grease a baking tray. 
In a pan, heat the dates with 200 mL water, bring to the boil, then reduce the 
heat and let simmer for 10 minutes. Check that there is enough water and that 
the dates are not burning. Add the soda and let cool.

Mix the butter, flour, vanilla, baking powder, eggs and milk thoroughly. Add 
the dates and whisk rapidly. Pour the batter in the baking tray and bake for 
20 minutes. To check it is cooked, plant a knife in the cake, it should come 
out clean. Let the cake cool.

To make the topping, heat the milk, butter and brown sugar in a saucepan on 
low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Add the icing sugar and mix well. Pour 
over the cake and sprinkle with walnuts.
