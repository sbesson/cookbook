Red wine cake
=============
.. note:: 
	Don't worry, the alcohol evaporates in the oven!

*Serves 8*

.. rubric:: Ingredients

- 250 g butter,
- 250 g flour,
- 200 g sugar,
- 4 eggs,
- 125 mL :index:`red wine <alcohol; red wine>`,
- 1 tsp cinnamon,
- 3 tsp :index:`cocoa`,
- 150 g :index:`chocolate chips` (milk or dark chocolate or mixed : it works 
  better with `Schokoladenstreusel` but I do not think they sell them here),
- 2 tsp baking powder,
- 1 tsp vanilla extract.

.. rubric:: Preparation

Preheat oven to 180ÂºC and grease a baking tray. 

Beat the butter to soften it and slowly whisk the eggs and the sugar in. Then 
slowly add the flour (possibly through a sieve), the cocoa powder, the baking 
powder and the vanilla extract and finally the chocolate chips. Then add the 
red wine, still stirring. Pour the mixture into the baking pan and bake 50 to 
60 minutes.

When the cake is cold, you can put an icing on top. To make this, mix icing 
sugar into a little bowl and add a little bit of red wine. This gives a pink 
creamy topping that you pour over the cake and let drizzle.
