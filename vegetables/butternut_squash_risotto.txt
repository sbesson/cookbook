butternut squash and cook gently for a further 5 minutes. Add the rice and 
stir until the all grains are well coated in oil. Keeping the stock hot in a 
separate pan, pour a ladleful onto the rice, stirring and simmering gently. 

Add more of the liquid as it becomes absorbed. Repeat until the rice is cooked 
but remains al dente, approximately 20 minutes. Stir in the sour cream and 
season to taste before serving.
