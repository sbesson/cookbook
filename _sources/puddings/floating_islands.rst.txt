Floating islands
================
*Serves 4*

.. rubric:: Ingredients

- 120 g caster sugar,
- 4 eggs,
- 1 tsp vanilla extract,
- 1 L milk 
- extra 150 g caster sugar for the caramel.

.. rubric:: Preparation

In a pan, heat up 800 mL milk with the vanilla extract. In a bowl, whisk 50 g 
sugar with the egg yolks until pale and light. Pour the boiling milk over 
gradually, mixing at all times with a wooden spoon and put back on low heat. 
Be careful not to let it boil. Keep stirring until the crème anglaise thickens 
and coats the wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and let cool in a shallow 
dish. 

Whisk the egg whites until they start getting firm. Add 60 g sugar and mix 
further. Heat the remaining milk in a pan. With two tablespoons, mould the egg 
whites to egg shapes and poach in the milk, 1 minute on each side. Let them to 
drain on a plate for 5-10 minutes and arrange them on the crème anglaise.

For the caramel, put the sugar in a pan with a few drops of lemon juice or 
water on high heat and leave until it boils. The syrup will get golden brown. 
Remove from heat (before the caramel burns) and rapidly drizzle over the 
floating islands. Refrigerate for an hour or two before eating.
