Heat oven to 180ÂºC and lightly butter the base and sides of a 900 g loaf tin 
and line with baking paper.

Tip the raspberry jam into a pan, warm through a little and stir until smooth. 
Gently stir in the raspberries, trying not to break up the fruit.

Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl, then stir in the caster 
sugar, ground almonds, most of the walnuts and lemon zest. Rub in the butter, 
then stir in the eggs.

Spoon half the mixture over the base of the tin. Layer about three quarters of 
the raspberry mixture over the top, then finish with the remaining cake 
mixture. Scatter with the remaining walnuts.
bake for 35-40 mins or until golden and firm to the touch. Cool on a wire 
rack. To serve, spoon the remaining raspberries over the cake and dust lightly 
with icing sugar.
