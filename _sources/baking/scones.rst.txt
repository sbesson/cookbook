Scones
======
*Makes 16*

.. rubric:: Ingredients

- ½ cup heavy cream plus additional for brushing the scones
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 tablespoons sugar plus additional for sprinkling the scones
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 1/4 cups cake flour (not self-rising)
- 1 tablespoon double-acting baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, cut into bits
- ½ cup dried :index:`currants`

.. rubric:: Preparation

In a bowl whisk together ½ cup of the cream, the egg, the vanilla, and 3 
tablespoons of the sugar until the mixture is combined well. In another bowl 
stir together the flour, the salt, the baking powder, and the baking soda and 
blend in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in the 
currants and the cream mixture with a fork until the mixture just forms a 
sticky but manageable dough. Knead the dough gently on a lightly floured 
surface for 30 seconds, pat it into a ½-inch-thick round, and with a 1 
½-inch fluted cutter cut it into rounds. Gather the scraps, repat the dough, 
and cut out more rounds. On an ungreased baking sheet brush the scones with 
the additional cream and sprinkle them with the additional sugar. Bake the 
scones in the middle of a preheated 400ºF. oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until 
they are golden.
