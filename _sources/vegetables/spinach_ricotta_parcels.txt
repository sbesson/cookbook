Put the spinach leaves in boiling water, leave for 2 minutes until the leaves 
are wilted. Put in a sieve and press out the water (a plate can be used to 
press the spinach while hot). Fry the onion and crushed garlic in olive oil. 
Add the spinach, ricotta, salt, pepper and parmesan. Stir well until creamy 
and keep warm.

Meanwhile, bring water to the boil and cook the lasagne sheets one by one. Put 
each sheet on a board, place the spinach and ricotta filling on it and fold 
into a parcel. Put in a dish and sprinkle extra parmesan before serving hot.
