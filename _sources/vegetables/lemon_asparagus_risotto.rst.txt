.. rubric:: Preparation

First slice the lemon and boil the slices in water for 5 minutes, so that the 
skin is no longer bitter. Strain and put aside. Chop the asparagus into small 
pieces and discard the stalk ends.

Melt the butter in a pan and fry the onions until transparent. Stir arborio 
rice briefly to coat with butter for 1-2 minutes, than add a cup of white wine 
followed by the stock. Stir constantly so that the rice does not get stuck at 
the bottom of the pan and burn. After 10 minutes of stirring, add the 
asparagus and continue stirring. When cooked, add the lemon slices and some 
parmesan. Served hot with rocket (arugula in the US) salad.
