Porcini and sundried tomato risotto
===================================
*Serves 4*

This is a wonderful recipe that can be made entirely from dried products and 
is therefore ideal on backpacking trips and when space for food is tight. We 
cooked it a couple of times while backpacking and camping in the wilderness. 
If cooked in a kitchen, the recipe can be more elaborate and the previous 
recipe can be followed.
