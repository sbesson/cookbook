Courgette risotto
=================
*Serves 4*

.. rubric:: Ingredients

- 20 g butter,
- 2 onions finely chopped,
- 4 :index:`courgettes`,
- 250 g risotto rice,
- 1 vegetable stock cube made to 900 mL,
- a bottle of :index:`white wine <alcohol; white wine>`,
- 100 g :index:`comté cheese <cheese; comté>`,
- :index:`parmesan cheese <cheese; parmesan>` to sprinkle,
- salt & pepper.

.. rubric:: Preparation

Sauté the onions and courgettes in butter. 
Start the courgettes a little bit before the onion because they take longer.

Stir arborio rice briefly to coat with butter, then put in a cup of white  
wine. Stirring constantly, keep adding vegetable stock and wine a little at a 
time whenever the liquid is absorbed.

It takes about 25 minutes (I think) once the rice goes in. When the rice is 
ready, stir in some a little butter, melt the cheese in and sprinkle with a 
handful of grated parmesan.
