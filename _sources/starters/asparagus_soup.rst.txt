Asparagus soup
==============
*Serves 4*

.. rubric:: Ingredients

- 15 cL crème fraîche,
- 1 L :index:`chicken stock <stock; chicken>`,
- 900 g :index:`asparagus`,
- 50 g butter,
- 2 tbsp flour,
- salt and pepper.

.. rubric:: Preparation

Cut the stalk ends of the asparagus (they get hard when you boil them). Save 
a few, slice them in half in their length and blanch them in water for 6-8 
minutes. Then put them aside for decoration on the soup.

Boil all the asparagus in the chicken stock for 15 minutes. Blend the 
asparagus and save the broth. Melt the butter in a large pan and add the   
flour. Cook and stir for 1 minute.

Add the asparagus puree and then the broth. Let it cook for 10 minutes and 
stir a little. Remove from the heat and add the cream. Warm the soup up 
without letting it boil (although mine boiled by mistake and it was OK).  Add 
salt and pepper to taste and decorate with the blanched asparagus.
