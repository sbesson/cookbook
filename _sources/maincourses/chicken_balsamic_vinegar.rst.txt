Heat the oil in a pan. Add the bacon, garlic and half of the rosemary. Remove 
from the heat once golden and reserve. Fry the chicken in the saucepan. 
Meanwhile, in the microwave heat up slowly the honey and balsamic vinegar. 

Coat the chicken with it and add the rosemary, bacon and garlic to the 
saucepan. Cook on medium heat for 45 minutes (less if you are cooking chicken 
breasts), taking care to turn the chicken and adding water if necessary. Add 
the mushroom, sliced and cook for a further 15 minutes.

Before serving, add the remaining rosemary and spray with extra balsamic 
vinegar. Serve with steamed vegetable and potato or rice.
