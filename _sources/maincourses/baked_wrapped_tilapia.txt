Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Combine all topping ingredients in a bowl. Season with 
salt and pepper to taste. Place a fillet on each piece of foil and divide 
topping evenly among them, spreading it over the top. Fold each foil over to 
form a packet around each fillet and seal the edge of each packet, crimping it 
tightly. Place on a baking sheet and bake 25 to 30 minutes.
