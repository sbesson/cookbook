.. rubric:: Preparation

Wash the rice extensively until the milky water goes clear (use this milky 
starchy water to nourish your plants- they're full of goodies).

Cook the rice in a non-stick pan.  Start with medium heat, and when you can 
hear it boiling, reduce the heat to low.  Key to successful rice cooking is to 
be patient and not to open the lid!  Keep it simmering for about 15-20 
minutes.  You can then have a little peek to see if the rice's cooked.  If you 
see little holes on the surface, then you're almost a sushi master!  Turn the 
heat off and let the rice steam for up to 30 mins.

While you're waiting for the rice, dissolve the salt, sugar and mirin with 
rice vinegar in a small pan or in a microwave.

Spread and cool the rice on a big plate/ tray and sprinkle the rice vinegar 
mixture onto the rice and mix evenly (NB: you can add more vinegar according 
to taste).  Fan the rice vigorously while you mix the rice, until it cools 
down.  The rice grains should be shiny (Tip: take the tray outside to cool if 
you're living in a cat/rain-free environment).

Cut the filling into fine strips.

Gently spread a 1cm  layer of rice on to the rough side of seaweed (shiny side 
down) - try not to press the rice down onto the seaweed. Place your favourite 
filling in a line and get rollin'

Cut the roll into cross recipe and enjoy the aesthetics or just bite into it! 
- enjoy with some soya sauce and wasabi.  Itadakimasu! (Bon appetit!)
