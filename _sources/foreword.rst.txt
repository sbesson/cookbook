Foreword

Here are a few recipes which have been cooked, tried out, exchanged, requested 
and loved. All recipes are associated with a little story and are close to my 
heart and probably to yours too for a reason or another. Some of them have 
their secrets and tips revealed here, some of them have been modified to 
accommodate our lifestyle (ie: what was available in the cupboard at the time) 
while others simply enter the "classics and favourites" categories. The 
storage cupboard recipes such as the Lisa's dal - truly wonderful- and 
flapjacks have rescued our dinners and breakfasts many times.

You'll notice the baking recipe is rather large and I have been conservative 
with the selection: you'll find only the best! In particular I'll mention the 
semolina and lemon cake, the cheese and potato bread, the chocolate 
cheesecake, the caramel and date slices requested by Keiko, Karen, Ann and 
Lisa respectively, while the orange and poppy seed cake is a general 
favourite. The tiramisu beats all italian ones and the rhubarb and ginger 
muffins are the "muffins of the year, well in!", the ginger addition being a 
personal touch.

The savoury recipes are not too be neglected with contributions from great 
cooks including my Mum and Ann's Mum. To finish, don't forget to season (most 
of you will have your little pot of sea salt by now!!) and if in doubt use 
butter over margarine.

Enjoy the cooking and the eating!
With much love,
Julie
